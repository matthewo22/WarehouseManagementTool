My Perspective:
As a computer science engineer working for an airline company I would want to create an application that can be used 
across all types of devices so that anyone working for the company can find out any information they need to on 
parts related to the aircrafts.The app would have a friendly UI that nearly any person could learn to use very 
quickly. 

Group Objective: 
Our groups goal would be to create the user-friendly interface. We will create an intuitive design that has a section 
for users to: 1.Find information on the part they are looking for, 2. Find where the part is located on the plane, and
3. Find how quickly the part will be available. In each of these sections of the application the user will be able to
quickly find what they need while we pull all the correct data when asked.

User Story #1

Mechanical Engineer
A mechanical engineer working on the plane of the company may realize that a part needs to be replaced. They would 
simply need to grab a device and load up our application. Once they type in the information for the specific part 
they need they can find out exactly how long it will take for the replacement part to arrive.

Aerospace Engineering Manager
An aerospace engineering manager at this company could be trying to explain to their group the part that is 
cracked or needs replacing in the plane but none of the group members could be understanding how vital it is
or where it is on the plane. The manager would simply need to load up our app on a nearby device and type in 
the part and be able to show their co-workers exactly where the part is located on the plane.

Chief Technician
Overlooking onsite requests and is in charge of replacing the part, but is trying to figure out how to allocate time 
most efficiently. As he is waiting for the part and can load the app to determine how much longer it will take the part
to arrive. Meanwhile he will continue working on other tasks and will come back to the task when the part is available. 

Fill in Scenario
	
	Scenario 3.1:
        Tom(Chief Technician) notifies Jimmy(Mechanical Engineer) about a failed inspection on an airplane at his airline's runway. Jimmy has a list
        of parts that need to ordered in order for the plane to pass inspection. Jimmy would place the order through the application for the warehouse
        manager to recieve. Jimmy will then check the application for an estimate on the order for the part. Tom will recieve a notification on the
        order for the repair and will be given instructions for the part's installation. Once Tom recieves the part he will update the 
        status for the order. Once the part is replaced he will confirm the passing inspection for the plane.

User Story #1: 

As a sales agent, I want to be able to search for airline parts. and be given exact/relevant parts related to my search.

Scenario: Veronica (sales agent) gets a call from Matt (client) who needs AN3 BOLTS (10-32) for his airline. Veronica goes on the app to query it. The search engine should display a match when it's that exact, and display similar results when it's not.

User Story #2: As a warehouse employee, I want to be able to update the inventory count of a product when I remove it to prepare it for shipment.

Scenario: Nate (warehouse employee) receives an order invoice for 50 aircraft wheels and goes to the location to prepare and package it. Before he put's in the packing sticker, he goes on the app to update -50 on the count of those wheels.

User Story 1: As a user, I want to be able to locate the part I need for assembling a plane or repairing a plane.

Scanerio 1: The customer is in need of a specific wing part for a plane. The user of the system should be 
able to search for that exact part number if they have it or sort by manufacturer of a particular 
wing part. The search should display parts with the most relevant search inputted.

User Story 2: As a seller, I want to be able to list parts for sale on the program and have it organized 
in a way that makes logical sense.

Scenario 2: The manufacturer or seller of aviation parts is looking to provide more ways for a 
customer to purchase there parts. The seller would want a system that can properly display 
information regarding the part and an easy user interface to begin selling. Using the system 
should be straightforward for the seller and give sellers ways to categorize the parts they are selling 
as well as input key information regarding that part.
