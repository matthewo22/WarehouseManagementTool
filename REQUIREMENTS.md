My Perspective:
As a computer science engineer working for an airline company I would want to create an application that can be used 
across all types of devices so that anyone working for the company can find out any information they need to on 
parts related to the aircrafts.The app would have a friendly UI that nearly any person could learn to use very 
quickly. 

Group Objective: 
Our groups goal would be to create the user-friendly interface. We will create an intuitive design that has a section 
for users to: 1.Find information on the part they are looking for, 2. Find where the part is located on the plane, and
3. Find how quickly the part will be available. In each of these sections of the application the user will be able to
quickly find what they need while we pull all the correct data when asked.

User Story #1

Mechanical Engineer
A mechanical engineer working on the plane of the company may realize that a part needs to be replaced. They would 
simply need to grab a device and load up our application. Once they type in the information for the specific part 
they need they can find out exactly how long it will take for the replacement part to arrive.

User Story #2

Aerospace Engineering Manager
An aerospace engineering manager at this company could be trying to explain to their group the part that is 
cracked or needs replacing in the plane but none of the group members could be understanding how vital it is
or where it is on the plane. The manager would simply need to load up our app on a nearby device and type in 
the part and be able to show their co-workers exactly where the part is located on the plane.

User Story #3

Chief Technician
Overlooking onsite requests and is in charge of replacing the part, but is trying to figure out how to allocate time 
most efficiently. As he is waiting for the part and can load the app to determine how much longer it will take the part
to arrive. Meanwhile he will continue working on other tasks and will come back to the task when the part is available. 

Fill in Scenario
	
	Scenario 3.1:
        Tom(Chief Technician) notifies Jimmy(Mechanical Engineer) about a failed inspection on an airplane at his airline's runway. Jimmy has a list
        of parts that need to ordered in order for the plane to pass inspection. Jimmy would place the order through the application for the warehouse
        manager to recieve. Jimmy will then check the application for an estimate on the order for the part. Tom will recieve a notification on the
        order for the repair and will be given instructions for the part's installation. Once Tom recieves the part he will update the 
        status for the order. Once the part is replaced he will confirm the passing inspection for the plane.

User Story (Plane Mechanic): 
As a Plane Mechanic

I want to know which parts are usually requested together

So that I can quickly lessen the amount of time the airplane is not functional

Scenario (Plane Mechanic):
An aircraft is not functional and in need of diagnosis and repair.  The mechanic opens the app and enters the symptoms into the interface.  The application provides possible diagnosis.  After the mechanic narrows down the possible solutions, the application provides a list of parts directly involved in the repair and also provides a list of suggested parts that were bought together that may indirectly be affected.
