My Perspective:
As a computer science engineer working for an airline company I would want to create an application that can be used 
across all types of devices so that anyone working for the company can find out any information they need to on 
parts related to the aircrafts.The app would have a friendly UI that nearly any person could learn to use very 
quickly. 

Group Objective: 
Our groups goal would be to create the user-friendly interface. We will create an intuitive design that has a section 
for users to: 1.Find information on the part they are looking for, 2. Find where the part is located on the plane, and
3. Find how quickly the part will be available. In each of these sections of the application the user will be able to
quickly find what they need while we pull all the correct data when asked.

User Story #1

Mechanical Engineer
A mechanical engineer working on the plane of the company may realize that a part needs to be replaced. They would 
simply need to grab a device and load up our application. Once they type in the information for the specific part 
they need they can find out exactly how long it will take for the replacement part to arrive.

Aerospace Engineering Manager
An aerospace engineering manager at this company could be trying to explain to their group the part that is 
cracked or needs replacing in the plane but none of the group members could be understanding how vital it is
or where it is on the plane. The manager would simply need to load up our app on a nearby device and type in 
the part and be able to show their co-workers exactly where the part is located on the plane.

Chief Technician
Overlooking onsite requests and is in charge of replacing the part, but is trying to figure out how to allocate time 
most efficiently. As he is waiting for the part and can load the app to determine how much longer it will take the part
to arrive. Meanwhile he will continue working on other tasks and will come back to the task when the part is available. 

Fill in Scenario
	
	Scenario 3.1:
        Tom(Chief Technician) notifies Jimmy(Mechanical Engineer) about a failed inspection on an airplane at his airline's runway. Jimmy has a list
        of parts that need to ordered in order for the plane to pass inspection. Jimmy would place the order through the application for the warehouse
        manager to recieve. Jimmy will then check the application for an estimate on the order for the part. Tom will recieve a notification on the
        order for the repair and will be given instructions for the part's installation. Once Tom recieves the part he will update the 
        status for the order. Once the part is replaced he will confirm the passing inspection for the plane.

User Story (Plane Mechanic): 
As a Plane Mechanic

I want to know which parts are usually requested together

So that I can quickly lessen the amount of time the airplane is not functional

Scenario (Plane Mechanic):
An aircraft is not functional and in need of diagnosis and repair.  The mechanic opens the app and enters the symptoms into the interface.  The application provides possible diagnosis.  After the mechanic narrows down the possible solutions, the application provides a list of parts directly involved in the repair and also provides a list of suggested parts that were bought together that may indirectly be affected.

User Story (Sales Manager)
As a Sales Manager

I want to suggest other parts to upsell the purchaser

So that I can increase revenue

Scenario (Sales Manager)
A customer chooses parts from our application.  While they are choosing parts, they are presented with a list of other parts that were purchases in conjunction along with a percentage of the amount of people who purchased the item after being presented with it.  This provides the purchaser with greater confidence that it may be wise to purchase these additional items.

I want to which parts will need to be serviced

So that I can minimize the time a plan is non-functional

Scenario (Plane Mechanic):
An aircraft has just concluded a flight.  The mechanic enter in the Serial Number (Unique Identified) of the plane into the application.  The application then provides a list of parts and when they should be checked for viability.

User Story #1
As a warehouse owner, I would like to know when certain items are popular so they can generate lots of sales and make sure they are in stock.
Scenario: John is a sales agent. John looks at the program to see which items will be popular in the coming months. This prediction is made from machine learning in the program. John will make sure that there is enough stock to compensate for the popularity of the item.

User Story #2
As a customer, I would like to know what current sales there are going on, and discounts are available, and what items are recommended to purchase with the current items I want.
Scenario: James is a customer. James is shopping for an aircraft wing. The program, using machine learning, recognizes that aircraft wings are frequently purchased with propellers. The program will suggest to James to also add propellers to his cart. The program will also suggest certain discounts and bundles related to what is in James’ cart.

User Story #1: As a warehouse owner I want to know when to purchase products and the amount of products to purchase to ensure my customers do not need to wait for orders. This would also allow me to optimize warehouse space by only having inventory of items that are currently being sold.

Scenario:

Harriana (warehouse owner) does not want to waste warehouse space on products that are seasonal. For example, aircraft Halloween decorations are only sold a couple of months before Halloween. Harriana does not want to purchase too many decorations that she will not be able to sell. The system should recommend the amount of products to buy depending on time of year and based on the sales history of the products. This would ensure that Harriana only has the needed amount of product and does not waste space or discard products. 

User Story #2: As a client, I would like to be able to see similar products that are often viewed and bought together to make sure I don't forget a needed component.

Scenario:

Jimbo (A client) found out that his company needs to order some new parts for his aircraft. He finds each of the needed components but forgot to order a bolt that is needed to attach them. The system should recommend the right bolt that is frequently purchased with these parts.
